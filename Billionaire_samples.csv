1,"Billionaires! Why even comprehend the insanity when you can ignorantly revel in it. After 100 years of America being controlled by monopolies and the general populace always nearing the breaking point (only for said point to be pushed further), we might just snap sooner or later. We should probably bring back child labor so the average adult can take Fridays off. It makes sense, after all. "

0, Stop fucking talking about how socialism is good when its not and will never be good

1, No there’s no way to become a billionaire without exploiting some kind of system and even if you did theoretically become a billionaire just by working hard you should be spending it to help other people being in a position that you can easily help people but choosing not to in evil in and of itself
0, Bill Gates dont seem too bad
1, Yo gonna be a billionaire by doing greedy shit so prob not
1, You cant get to the top without being an asshole
0, Gates  Musk I would consider pretty alright billionaires
0, I’d hardly consider someone who gives away enough money to make him not the worlds richest man evil and gates has limited his children to an inheritance of 1 million dollars with most of his money I think going into charities after his death
1, but they still make underpaid children in africa mine cobalt and other valuable materials
1, He is using other people’s situations to screw them over and make money he has enough money to you now not hire starving children And also most donations that billionaires do make are to llc’s which they own so the money goes into their own banks while ppl support them they basically profit
