0," The issue with this post is the post is only making a usee have to respond with one answer ""Yes"" and  no other answer. If you respond with a ""No"" you get downvoted like crazy.Is that fair? It's like forcing it onto someone because they have no other choice. This happens in real life too you can't go around and say ""I don't support LGBTQ"" without being harassed in public. You might say ""They didn't have to respond and they could've ignored it"" but tell me the post lures people in. It's on the front page just a few scrolls and you'll see  it.I understand many of you will downvote me for saying this I understand but it'll be great to listen to my point of view and assess it correct me ( I'd really appreciate that ) and let's have a civil conversation on the validity of this statement."

0, Yup I respect all rights
0, Like yes everyone regardless of what they believe should have the same equal rights can we just stop ignoring basic biology? Yes these guys can believe what they want and have the same exact rights as us (which they do) but we should really stop acting like their belief is true  as it's just another anti science sentiment.
1, Yes. Why would I not?
0, No.
0, Bold of you to assume I support any rights for anyone. ***IF NO ONE HAS RIGHTS THEN NO ONE CAN HAVE THIER RIGHTS VIOLATED!***
0, No. I support human rights
0,"Trans rights Tf. People need to stop talkin about rights. Everyone has the same rights. It is literally fucking illegal to discriminate against people and being respected by other people is not a right. Nobody is obligated to like anyone including myself. Now to answer the question depends if you're a good fuckin person. If you make it you're entire personality get the fuck out of my life but if its just a fact and you don't force every conversation to be about that then yea I respect you. Same goes with gays bis etc. I despise anyone who makes being LGBT their entire personality. Its your sexuality or ""gender"" not your reason for living. People wouldn't be thrilled if I walked around saying I'm a straight cis gender male so I don't see why people think being an aliensexual nonbinary attack helicopter is any different.To clarify this prolly sounds aggressive but I'm a pretty passive aggressive person in general haha. A lot of things I say sound aggressive but its just how I word things."

0, I'm so sorry op.
0, Why
0, No not that they don’t deserve rights but seriously. If you’re born with a shlong it’s yours. Not even you can change that. Possession of the shlong means you are of the male gender. No shlong = woman… simple. You can’t decide what gender you are that’s predetermined by chance.

0, Enough r/196 spam.
0, What do you mean trans rights? People always say”trans rights” but it’s so vague. What rights do they not have? If you mean a biological man going into a woman’s bathroom because they claim to be a woman? No I don’t support that.You can’t simply just say “trans rights.” It’s more complicated. Sure I support them having basic human rights but nothing more than everyone else.
0, Nooooii

0, No
0, NoEdit : it was to be look rebel i actually dont mind
0, It completely depends on the person and what they do.Like if someone is in public dressing feminine and looking feminine but demands to be called he/him I don’t understand it. I get that men can dress feminine but I’m talking like boobs out and looking female I don’t understand why they won’t put at-least an effort into looking masculine and representing their pronouns.My friend Alex is trans (ftm) and he hasn’t gotten any surgery or anything and obviously still looks like a girl but he puts EFFORT into trying to look like a guy.
0, Using characters like this is stupid. Ditto doesn’t exist ditto is not aware of transgender rights and ditto has nothing to do with this. Like almost every other video game/cartoon character. If you wanna support trans rights I’d recommend actually doing something that could help them like protesting or spreading awareness without using cute characters as a way to “force it” on people. “Spreading awareness” by using cute non existent characters make it seem like trans rights isn’t as serious as it is.
0, If I jumped off a bridge would you?
0, i dont support any rights we are all children of ji jin ping and we do not have rights we only have privliges

0, Not really because your born as who you are and that's how i feel.
0, I don’t agree with the idea that you can change your sex but they are still people and need help. I feel sorry for them
0," I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MY COMMENT AND I DO NOT INTEND TO HURT ANY INDIVIDUAL IN ANY WAY READ THE FULL COMENT BEFORE TAKING SOME WRONG IDEA OF MY COMMENTI hate LGBT (not born bisexuals)But liking the same gender is completely un-natural and just pure evil intentions Why don't we follow the nature A man and a woman/women in case men are born lesser than women in many parts of world females are aborted before birth thats another thing I hate Besides that you need straight people anyways for homosexuals to reproduce And a child needs both a mother and a father to have a healthy mindsetCuz a father cannot give enough love to a child that a mother can and a mother can't provide enough seciurity to her child as a father doesWhat born bisexuals shall do is to go through some sort of operation to change their sex to the most dominant part Sexuality is physical not mental people just gonna come and say ""hey i'm a tree/bird/e.t.c"" Sometimes its hard to deal with identity confusion but we should use our brain Theres no coincidences in nature and its perfect in all aspects Then theres 0% possibility of you being a soul of a bird/tree stuck inside a humanThen we come to being Lesbian/Gay For that we can say that its completely un-natural and just an urge that has come to spoil us Besides what society says its itself filthyA man can never impregnate another man naturallyWhy else were men and women made then if not to mate with eachother ? Why would males and females coexist then ?So if you read this whole comment and felt im wrong at some point feel free to reply and i request for my comment not to be removed i fid not put it here to hurt anyone but ask if theres something wrong with how i think im open to change in my thinking if you prove me wrong logically/scientifically"
1, If course I am transgender myself
0, No
0, No
0, Nah
0, no i dont care
0, no
0, Nha why the fuck would I do that. Trans right is the most downie thing when you think about it. Why does it even exist if you change gender you should adopt their rights. You don't need a new sets of rights you weird blue hat wearing freaks
0, This have rights but not *extra* rights
0, In my opinion i don’t think it’s scientifically proven but i also think that people should be allowed to do whatever they want with themselves and its wrong to stop people from doing so
0, Nope
0, No
0, No it’s gay

0, No😤😤😤😤😤😤😤🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
0, Sniff your butt
1, Yes
1, i do
0, I don’t really give a shit you can pretend to be whatever you want but it’s important to remember that subjective belief does not determine objective reality. Just because a biological male SUBJECTIVELY FEELS that he is more feminine than masculine does NOT make him OBJECTIVELY a woman. Downvote me all you want you can’t alter objective reality with your beliefs and I don’t give a damn.As for other LGB minus the T matters I generally support it.
0, No
0, i do notalthough i won't give the slightest fucks if you are just don't bother me and come rubbing it under my nose
0, I knew the fucking communities would get to pokemon :(
0, No I don't want a 40 y/o dude with a dick share the same WC as the 9 y/o girl tho I don't care if you wear   women clothes or anything like that
0, No!
0, No
0, No.
0, Please downvote me I just want to say hi to people who sort by controversial
0, Nope
0, I question me of wich toilet do they pick boys or girls
0, Of course it's not like it's their fault
0, No because they already have them. No need to give them more freedom than the average and ordinary is there? Sure protect them from harrasment but... giving them more rights than others is not the way. Not the path. Surely they will get integrated easier as time goes on.
0, If you find a male ditto  can it still turn into a female with a vag
0, y- yes?
1, Yes
1, Yes
1, Heck yeah I do
0, No dont give a single fuck about them

0, No
1, Yes
0, No I don't support trans rights. I don't support any rights at all. We all should become slaves to the lizard people.
0, No
0, I don’t support them so like I won’t do a parade or a march but I they do need equal rights but that doesn’t exclude them from having equal wrongs
0, When they are trans yes when they are trans just to plaster pride flags everywhere for attention no
0," Since the most interesting things happenes when people say ""no"" I'll say noBut idc actually"
0, No
0, No
0, Do i have to? If not then no because do i have to care?
0, no
0, Well I don't support it nor am I against it. Although I do respect the person as a whole no matter what religion belief sexual orientation they are. I'd like to be able to meet different ppl with different backgrounds and so I don't mind if someone else is deciding to become or is already trans so long as it doesn't affect me majorly.
0, I don't care. I neither support them nor I am against them. As a human being I have a right to be neutral
0, Lmao no😂😂😂😂😂
0," I do not support trans rights. If existing rights were equally enforced everything would have been more or less ok (don't get me wrong life would still suck but it would suck equally as bad for a trans as for a white straight male - the mythical creature that according to SJWs does not have any problems in life lol). You cannot defeat prejudice by simply protecting a group oppressed by society with law. Moreover by doing that you're just putting these people out onto a pedestal as if saying ""look they're different"".Then again I wouldn't consider myself versed well enough in law or all that gender stuff to form a proper opinion so I might as well be talking out mu ass 🤷‍♂️."
0, Is this even question your allowed to truthfully answer? Not really

0, No because I don't have to
0, People always say that but no one ever say which rights they are supposed to be. So before I can take a stance please explain what those rights are?
0, What do you mean by that? If you mean rights like freedom of speech be alive etc those are human rights. Of course they need human rights they are humans after all. If you don’t mean that they do not need anything special rights. They are just people like everyone else.
0, I don’t really care about trans rights. I care about human rights.I should probably say I include trans people as human.
0, what rights do they not have
